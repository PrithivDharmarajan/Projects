\n\nTHIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (“CALIX GIGAMANAGE”) IS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN CALIX, INC. (“CALIX”) AND YOU AS END USER (“YOU” OR “END USER”) FOR RIGHTS TO USE CALIX GIGAMANAGE (“SOFTWARE”) PROVIDED BY CALIX. THIS Calix Gingamanage IS LIMITED TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.

\n\nCALIX EXPRESSLY REJECTS ANY TERMS OR CONDITIONS THAT ARE NOT SET FORTH IN THIS Calix Gingamanage. PLEASE READ THE Calix Gingamanage CAREFULLY AS IT IS LEGALLY BINDING. BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING OR USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THE Calix Gingamanage. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF ANOTHER PERSON OR A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO ACT FOR AND TO BIND THAT PERSON, COMPANY, OR LEGAL ENTITY TO THESE TERMS.  IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MUST NOT ACCEPT THIS Calix Gingamanage AND MAY NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.


\n\n\n1.	Permitted Use; Term.
\n1.1	Subject to the terms and conditions of this Calix Gingamanage, Calix hereby grants End User, during the Term (as defined below), a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable, limited right to access and use the Software solely in connection with one or more Calix offerings (including product, cloud service and/or software offerings) for End User’s network needs (the “Permitted Use”). This Calix Gingamanage does not entitle End User to any technical support with respect to the Software. Calix reserves the right to provide support in its sole discretion and at such terms as Calix shall in its sole discretion determine.

\n\n1.2	The “Term” shall begin upon End User’s download of the Software and shall continue until the earlier of (i) termination of this Calix Gingamanage by either party, or (ii) End User discontinuing use of the Software. Calix may immediately terminate this Calix Gingamanage for convenience or in the event End User breaches this Calix Gingamanage or any terms associated with Calix offerings in connection with the Permitted Use. End User agrees that a breach of this Calix Gingamanage shall constitute a material default for which Calix may have no adequate remedy at law, such that injunctive or other equitable relief may be appropriate to restrain such breach, whether threatened or actual. Upon termination of this Calix Gingamanage, the license granted to End User shall terminate and End User shall immediately discontinue using the Software. Upon request, End User will certify to Calix that it has deleted and/or destroyed all copies of the Software. In the event of expiration or termination of this Agreement, Sections 1.2, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will survive and continue in effect.

\n\n2.	Restrictions.
\n2.1	End User shall not itself, or through any parent, subsidiary, affiliate, agent or other third party permit any third party to (i) use the Software other than for the Permitted Use; (ii) sell, lease, license, transfer, sublicense, make any external commercial use of or any way distribute the Software, (iii) provide, disclose, divulge or make available to, or permit use of the Software by any third party, (iv) copy, modify or reproduce, translate, reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, or create derivative works based on, or copy the Software or any portion thereof, (v) directly or indirectly use the Software in any way to build a competitive product or service, (vi) modify any proprietary rights notices that appear in the Software or components thereof, or (vii) use the Software in violation of any applicable laws and regulations (including any export laws, restrictions, national security controls and regulations).

\n\n2.2	End User shall notify Calix promptly of any unauthorized use of any password or account or any other known or suspected breach of security or misuse of the Software. End User is responsible for use of the Software by any and all employees, or other users that it allows to access the Software.

\n\n3.	Confidentiality
\n3.1	“Confidential Information” means non-public information, technical data or know-how of a party and/or its affiliates, which is furnished to the other party in written or tangible form in connection with this Calix Gingamanage.  Oral disclosure will also be deemed Confidential Information if it would reasonably be considered to be of a confidential nature or if it is confirmed at the time of disclosure to be confidential.

\n\n3.2	Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information does not include information which is: (i) already in the possession of the receiving party and not subject to a confidentiality obligation to the providing party; (ii) independently developed by the receiving party; (iii) publicly disclosed through no fault of the receiving party; (iv) rightfully received by the receiving party from a third party that is not under any obligation to keep such information confidential; (v) approved for release by written agreement with the disclosing party; or (vi) disclosed pursuant to the requirements of law, regulation, or court order, provided that the receiving party will promptly inform the providing party of any such requirement and cooperate with any attempt to reasonably limit such disclosure or to procure a protective order or similar treatment.

\n\n3.3	Neither party will use the other party’s Confidential Information except as reasonably required for the performance of this Calix Gingamanage.  Each party will hold in confidence the other party’s Confidential Information by means that are no less restrictive than those used for its own confidential materials. Each party agrees not to disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to anyone other than its employees or subcontractors who are bound by confidentiality obligations and who need to know the same to perform such party’s obligations hereunder.

\n\n3.4	Upon termination or expiration of this Calix Gingamanage, except as otherwise agreed in writing or otherwise stated in this Calix Gingamanage, each party will, upon the request of the disclosing party, either: (i) return all of such Confidential Information of the disclosing party and all copies thereof in the receiving party’s possession or control to the disclosing party; or (ii) destroy all Confidential Information and all copies thereof in the receiving party’s possession or control.  The receiving party will at the request of the disclosing party certify in writing that no copies have been retained by the receiving party, its employees or agents.

\n\n3.5	In case a party receives legal process that demands or requires disclosure of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information, such party will give prompt notice to the disclosing party, if legally permissible, to enable the disclosing party to challenge such demand.

\n\n3.6	The receiving party acknowledges that unauthorized disclosure of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information could cause substantial harm to the disclosing party for which damages alone might not be a sufficient remedy and, therefore, that upon any such disclosure by the receiving party the disclosing party will be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law or equity.

\n\n4.	User Data.
\n4.1	End User is responsible for all data, information or material provided, submitted or otherwise transmitted by End User through the Software (“User Data”).
