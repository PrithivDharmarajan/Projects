Any User Content provided by you remains your property. However, by providing User Content to BASE™, you grant Bridge a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferrable, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, and otherwise exploit in any manner such User Content in all formats and distribution channels now known or hereafter devised (including in connection with the Services and BASE™’s business and on third-party sites and services), without further notice to or consent from you, and without the requirement of payment to you or any other person or entity.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">9. Payment. A Buyer understands that use of the Services may result in charges to you for the services or goods you receive from a Seller (“Charges”). After you have received services or goods obtained through your use of the Service, Bridge will facilitate your payment of the applicable Charges on behalf of Seller, as such Seller’s limited payment collection agent. Payment of the Charges in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly by Buyer to Seller. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges paid by Buyer are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Bridge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by Bridge using the preferred payment method designated in your Account, after which Bridge will send you a receipt by email. If your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that Bridge may, as Seller’s limited payment collection agent, use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As between you and Bridge, BRIDGE reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time in Bridge’s sole discretion. Further, you acknowledge and agree that Charges applicable in certain geographical areas may increase substantially during times of high demand. Bridge will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for Charges incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof. Bridge may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers and discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you. Buyer may elect to cancel Buyer’s request for services or goods from Seller at any time prior to the shipping of the goods or provision of the services by Seller, as the case may be, in which case Buyer may be charged a cancellation fee. This payment structure is intended to fully compensate Seller for the services or goods provided.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">11. Dispute Resolution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">11.1 Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in County of Los Angeles, California, before one arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The arbitrator may, in the award, allocate all or part of the costs of the arbitration, including the fees of the arbitrator and the reasonable attorneys’ fees of the prevailing party.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">11.2 Mediation. Prior to the appointment of the arbitrator(s), and within 10 days from the date of commencement of the arbitration, the parties shall submit the dispute to JAMS for mediation. The parties will cooperate with JAMS and with one another in selecting a mediator from JAMS panel of neutrals, and in promptly scheduling the mediation proceedings. The parties covenant that they will participate in the mediation in good faith, and that they will share equally in its costs. All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the mediation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, experts and attorneys, and by the mediator or any JAMS employees, are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment, in any arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the mediation. If the dispute is not resolved within 30 days from the date of the submission of the dispute to mediation (or such later date as the parties may mutually agree in writing), the administration of the arbitration shall proceed forthwith. The mediation may continue, if the parties so agree, after the appointment of the arbitrators. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the mediator shall be disqualified from serving as arbitrator in the case. The pendency of a mediation shall not preclude a party from seeking provisional remedies in aid of the arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction, and the parties agree not to defend against any application for provisional relief on the ground that a mediation is pending.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">11.3 Submission to Arbitration. The parties agree that any and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be submitted to JAMS, or its successor, for mediation, and if the matter is not resolved through mediation, then it shall be submitted to JAMS, or its successor, for final and binding arbitration pursuant to the arbitration clause set forth above. Either party may commence mediation by providing to JAMS and the other party a written request for mediation, setting forth the subject of the dispute and the relief requested. The parties will cooperate with JAMS and with one another in selecting a mediator from JAMS panel of neutrals, and in scheduling the mediation proceedings. The parties covenant that they will participate in the mediation in good faith, and that they will share equally in its costs. All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the mediation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, experts and attorneys, and by the mediator or any JAMS employees, are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment, in any arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the mediation. Either party may initiate arbitration with respect to the matters submitted to mediation by filing a written demand for arbitration at any time following the initial mediation session or 45 days after the date of filing the written request for mediation, whichever occurs first. The mediation may continue after the commencement of arbitration if the parties so desire. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the mediator shall be disqualified from serving as arbitrator in the case.</p>
