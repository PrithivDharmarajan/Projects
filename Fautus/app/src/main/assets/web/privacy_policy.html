We do not keep information about Photographers&rsquo; bank routing numbers, tax information, social security numbers or any other payment information provided by Photographers.

Consumers and Photographers that have been matched for a Moment or start a Snap Moment or related Services are able to see basic information about each other, such as names, photo, ratings, and any information they have added to their Profiles. Photographers see the location that the Consumer has provided. Consumers see a Photographer&rsquo;s information and real-time location as the Photographer approaches the Consumers&rsquo; location. In some instances, Consumers&rsquo; ratings of Photographers are shared with Photographers on a weekly basis. We de-identify the ratings and feedback, but we can&rsquo;t rule out that a Photographer may be able to identify the Consumer that provided the rating or feedback.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Although we help Consumers and Photographers communicate with one another to arrange a Service, we do not share your actual phone number or other contact information with other Users.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sharing between Fautus Consumers</span><span class="c2">.
