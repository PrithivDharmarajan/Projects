This agreement to arbitrate (&ldquo;Arbitration Agreement&rdquo;) is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and survives after the Agreement terminates or your relationship with Fautus ends. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.

THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS INTENDED TO REQUIRE ARBITRATION OF EVERY CLAIM OR DISPUTE THAT CAN LAWFULLY BE ARBITRATED, EXCEPT FOR THOSE CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WHICH BY THE TERMS OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT ARE EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED FROM THE REQUIREMENT TO ARBITRATE.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">(b) Prohibition of Class Actions and Non-Individualized Relief. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">You understand and agree that you and Fautus may each bring Claims in arbitration against the other only in an individual capacity and not on a class, collective action, or representative basis (&ldquo;Class Action Waiver&rdquo;). You understand and agree that you and Fautus both are waiving the right to pursue or have a dispute resolved as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective or representative proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this subsection (b) shall not apply to representative private attorneys general act claims brought against Fautus, which are addressed separately in Section 17(c). </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue any relief on any basis other than an individual basis.

In any case in which: (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or representative action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable as to any Claims, the class, collective, and/or representative action on such Claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the Class Action Waiver shall be enforced in arbitration on an individual basis as to all other Claims to the fullest extent possible.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">(c) Representative PAGA Waiver. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Arbitration Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law: (1) you and Fautus agree not to bring a representative action on behalf of others under the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (&ldquo;PAGA&rdquo;), California Labor Code &sect; 2698 et seq., in any court or in arbitration, and (2) for any claim brought on a private attorney general basis, including under the California PAGA, both you and Fautus agree that any such dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only (i.e., to resolve whether you have personally been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective proceeding (i.e., to resolve whether other individuals have been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law) (collectively, &ldquo;representative PAGA Waiver&rdquo;). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: (i) the unenforceable provision shall be severed from this Agreement; (ii) severance of the unenforceable provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the Arbitration Agreement or the requirement that any remaining Claims be arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; and (iii) any such representative PAGA or other representative private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any Claims to be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction because a civil court of competent jurisdiction determines that the representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those Claims, the Parties agree that litigation of those Claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual Claims in arbitration.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">(d) Rules Governing the Arbitration. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) pursuant to its </span><span class="c8"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.adr.org/aaa/faces/rules/searchrules/rulesdetail?_afrWindowId%3D57rsw71ei_1%26_afrLoop%3D1335893675945842%26doc%3DADRSTAGE2021424%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3Dhf27f5iaa_4%23%252540%25253F_afrWindowId%25253D57rsw71ei_1%252526_afrLoop%25253D1335893675945842%252526doc%25253DADRSTAGE2021424%252526_afrWindowMode%25253D0%252526_adf.ctrl-state%25253D57rsw71ei_79&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1494557269496000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFZjh9FRqybQXix-V7Omc2oH9x-9A">Consumer Arbitration Rules</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, as modified by the terms set forth in this Agreement.

The arbitrator may award any individualized remedies that would be available in court. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party&#39;s individual claims.

If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the claim is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. </span></li><li class="c0"><span class="c1">If Fautus initiates arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, Fautus will pay all AAA filing and arbitration fees. </span></li><li class="c0"><span class="c1">With respect to any Claims brought by Fautus against a Photographer, or for Claims brought by a Photographer against Fautus that: (A) are based on an alleged employment relationship between Fautus and a Photographer; (B) arise out of, or relate to, Fautus&rsquo; actual deactivation of a Photographer&rsquo;s User account or a threat by Fautus to deactivate a Photographer&rsquo;s User account; (C) arise out of, or relate to, Fautus&rsquo; actual termination of a Photographer&rsquo;s Agreement with Fautus under the termination provisions of this Agreement, or a threat by Fautus to terminate a Photographer&rsquo;s Agreement; or (D) arise out of, or relate to, Fares (as defined in this Agreement, including Fautus compensation share), tips, or average hourly guarantees owed by Fautus to Photographers for Services, other than disputes relating to referral bonuses, other Fautus promotions, or consumer-type disputes (the subset of Claims in subsections (A)-(D) shall be collectively referred to as &ldquo;Photographer Claims&rdquo;), Fautus shall pay all costs unique to arbitration (as compared to the costs of adjudicating the same claims before a court), including the regular and customary arbitration fees and expenses (to the extent not paid by Fautus pursuant to the fee provisions above). However, if you are the party initiating the Photographer Claim, you shall be responsible for contributing up to an amount equal to the filing fee that would be paid to initiate the claim in the court of general jurisdiction in the state in which you provide Services to Consumers, unless a lower fee amount would be owed by you pursuant to the AAA Rules, applicable law, or subsection (e)(1) above.

If AAA arbitration is unavailable in your county, the arbitration hearings will take place in the nearest available location for a AAA arbitration. If your Claim is for $10,000 or less, Fautus agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as determined by the AAA Rules. If your Claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">(g) Exceptions to Arbitration. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">This Arbitration Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following types of claims: (1) small claims actions brought on an individual basis that are within the scope of such small claims court&rsquo;s jurisdiction; (2) a representative action brought on behalf of others under PAGA or other private attorneys general acts, to the extent the representative PAGA Waiver in Section 17(c) of such action is deemed unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction; (3) claims for workers&rsquo; compensation, state disability insurance and unemployment insurance benefits; and (4) claims that may not be subject to arbitration as a matter of law.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement prevents you from making a report to or filing a claim or charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, U.S. Department of Labor, Securities Exchange Commission, National Labor Relations Board, or Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, or similar local, state or federal agency, and nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall be deemed to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any agency in order to fulfill the party&#39;s obligation to exhaust administrative remedies before making a claim in arbitration, however you knowingly and voluntarily waive the right to seek or recover money damages of any type pursuant to any administrative complaint and instead may seek such relief only through arbitration under this Agreement.
